The folders contain the code used for the research.

Examples > experimental contains the first steps (1.0-4.0) to prepare the original data and generate synthetic data.
3.x give background information on the original datasets and are thus removed due to confidentiality, where x represents the subset number.
Next, the QMs-S are done for subset 1-3 in step 5.1-5.3.
Next, step 6.0 prepares the data for the QMs-P.
The QMs-P are executed in step 7.x-9.x, where x represents the subset number.

Experiments > data is where the data was saved. This folder is empty due to confidentiality of the data.
Experiments > evaluation_results is where the figure results are saved (incl data descriptives).

Quality_evaluation is where the python code for the functions used in the 'experimental' scripts are saved.
They are saved as predictive_metrics for QMs-P and statistical_metrics for QMs-S.

Synthetis is where the functions used for syntetic data generation is saved.
